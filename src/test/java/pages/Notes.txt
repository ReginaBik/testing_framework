/* WINDOW HANDLING NOTES:
getWindowHandle() method returns the unique id for current window as a String. SYNTAX: --> String currentWindowId = driver.getWindowHandle();
getWindowHandles() method returns all window ids that opened in browser by Selenium, and it will return a set of unique window ids. SYNTAX: --> Set<String> allWindowIds = driver.getWindowHandles();
switchTo() method can be used to switch window or tab. SYNTAX: --> driver.switchTo().window(windowToBeSwitched);

driver.close() method is used to close current window that Selenium focus is on.
driver.quit() is used to close all the windows opened in a particular browser session.
Note: NoSuchWindowException WILL BE THROWN IF ANY ACTION ARE PERFORM ON A WINDOW THAT NO LONGER EXIST.

HOW TO SWITCH TO 'CHILD' WINDOW?
1. Get id (handle) of the parent (main) window
2. Get id (handle) of the all windows for opened with browser session and store in a set
3. Create an Iterator to loop through each window handle and once the window handle is not equal to main window handle, switch
